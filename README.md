## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
The second assignment is to create the caster mount. The base's dimensions are 100 mm x 100 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 4 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges and one big hole in the middle.

### Reflection
This is way easier than Solidworks, plus it is easier to do things and add new sketches to it.

## Fork

### Description
The third assignment is to make a fork to hold the tire, and the wheel. It is 80mm in diameter and 8m thick,it has two rectangles 40mm wide,5mm tall, and 25mm away from the bottom edge of the origin, extruded 75mm. With a 15mm,1mm,and 4mm fillet.

### Reflection
I remember in SolidWorks it was way harder to do this but now i can do this part in less than five minutes, due to adding pultiple sketches in one sketch.

## Tire

### Description
The fourth assignment was harder but I got it done quick,its hard to describe the dimensions because of the weird shape.
### Evidence

### Reflection
It seemed the same as SolidWorks, but it is also easier becuase you can just add stuff to sketches without adding more sketches.

## Wheel

### Description
The fifth assignment also had many shapes so its really hard to actually specify the dimensions of the real thing.
### Evidence

### Reflection
This was actually really easy you just have to know what your doing and be a quick learner. It seemed quicker than SolidWorks because of the sketching and the rotation method.

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description
Thare are two different parts to this assignment one for axel and collar and one for bearing. Both were pretty easy and pretty small to make.

### Reflection
This was way easier than SolidWorks and it was way easier to add new parts to new sketches.

---


## Assembly

### Description
This was pretty hard to assemble because this is a new program to me and its the hardest thing to learn in a new can system.
### Evidence

### Reflection
This was the hardest thing that I did in Onshape, the hardest part is trying to get it to be able to learn all of the mates and trying to get it to correctly place.
