## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
The second assignment is to create the caster mount. The base's dimensions are 100 mm x 100 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 4 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges and one big hole in the middle.

### Reflection
This is way easier than Solidworks, plus it is easier to do things and add new sketches to it.

## Fork

### Description
The third assignment is to make a fork to hold the tire, and the wheel. It is 80mm in diameter and 8m thick,it has two rectangles 40mm wide,5mm tall, and 25mm away from the bottom edge of the origin, extruded 75mm. With a 15mm,1mm,and 4mm fillet.

### Reflection
I remember in SolidWorks it was way harder to do this but now i can do this part in less than five minutes, due to adding pultiple sketches in one sketch.
